We created an analysis of cryptocurrencies on the market through unsupervised machine learning. We processed the data, fit the machine learning model, clustered, reduced the dimensions, and reduced the principal components using PCA. The final report includes data visualization of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.
